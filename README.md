A fun bit to show, whether the Holy roman emperors were passive-aggressive assholes to their subject bishops and other church personnel during the investiture controversy.

A very much work in progress.

Pre-requirements:

charter_locations_1-centers_added.json from https://github.com/flipz357/regesta-imperii-to-semgis in /res (raw already contains example subsets from HeinrichIV and KonradIV)

a subset or the entire Regesta Imperii .csv export https://gitlab.rlp.net/adwmainz/regesta-imperii/lab/regesta-imperii-data/-/tree/main/data/regesta-csv (ideally with the Batch nominatim geocoder already run and exported with X,Y coordinates) in /res
